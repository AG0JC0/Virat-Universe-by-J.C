          Virat Kohli’s life journey is a story of passion, discipline, and determination. Born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi, he showed a strong love for cricket from a very young age and joined a cricket academy when he was just nine. He worked hard through school-level and state-level cricket and became known for his strong batting and fearless attitude. Kohli first came into the spotlight when he captained the Indian Under-19 team to win the 2008 World Cup. Later that same year, he made his international debut for India. Over the years, through consistent performance and dedication, he became one of the world’s best batsmen across all formats. Kohli also served as the captain of the Indian cricket team, leading the team to many memorable victories and helping India reach the top of Test rankings. Known for his fitness, energy, and passion on the field, he has inspired millions of young players. From a young boy in Delhi to a global cricket superstar, Virat Kohli’s journey proves how hard work and confidence can turn dreams into success.
